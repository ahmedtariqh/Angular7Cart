1)A constructor is being called right after the creation of the component, long before data to be passed to it is ready and populated, while ngOnInit only runs after the first cycle of changes to the data, so you have access to your component inputs.
2)it is preferable to use the constructor for constants, like things that are actually being hard-coded into your component, and ngOnInit for everything that depends on external data.
